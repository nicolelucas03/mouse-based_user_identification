### Goal :dart:
The goal of our research project is to investigate the feasibility of using mouse movement patterns as a method for uniquely identifying individual users on a webpage. Specifically, we aim to analyze multiple aspects of mouse behavior, including movement velocity, trajectory, frequency of clicks, and hover patterns to determine if these elements can be used as distinctive biometric identifiers. Unlike traditional tracking methods such as IP-based identification or cookies which often raise privacy concerns, mouse movement analysis offers an alternative that respects user anonymity while still participating in behavior-based identification. This research will also focus on handling the inherent noise in the collected mouse movement data. Due to factors such as variability in user interactions, device types, and even environmental conditions, mouse movements are accompanied by random fluctuations that can obscure meaningful patterns. As part of our research, we will explore techniques for filtering and processing this noise to enhance the accuracy and reliability of user identification. Ultimately, this research seeks to determine whether mouse movement patterns, despite their noisy nature, can provide a reliable means of identifying users across different browsing sessions or web pages.
